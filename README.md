A live, radial map of your home network for Home Assistant. Every device orbits the router, switch, access point or mesh node it connects through, colored by whether it's answering right now, was seen recently, or has gone quiet.

Install it, click Submit, and NetOrbit draws the best map your network can tell it about. Then fix anything it couldn't work out by dragging devices around, pasting a client list, or asking an AI assistant to do it for you.

## What it does

- **Finds every device.** Sweeps your subnet, learns MAC addresses from the ARP table, and names devices from what your setup already knows: Home Assistant's device list, device trackers, Ping sensors you've set up, your router's local DNS, or the name the device announces over Bonjour. When nothing knows a name, it falls back to the maker (for example "Apple 28:54"), and you can rename it.
- **Finds your network gear.** Spots routers, switches, access points and mesh nodes from who made them, what they call themselves, what they announce on the network, and what other integrations already know. Obvious ones are added for you. Likely ones show up with a spinning pink ring and a one-tap "It's a hub / Not a hub".
- **Works out where each device connects, when your network will say:**
  - **Managed switches with SNMP:** NetOrbit reads their MAC address tables and works out which switch port, and so which access point, every device is behind. No port mapping needed.
  - **UniFi**, and other integrations that report which access point each client uses (Netgear/Orbi's per-device "connected AP" sensors, for example).
- **Lets you place the rest, three ways:**
  1. **Drag and drop on the card.** Tap *Edit layout*, drag a device onto its hub, or tap it for *Move to*, *Make it a hub* and *Automatic*.
  2. **Paste a client list.** Copy the client list from an access point's web page or a mesh app, paste it into NetOrbit, pick the hub. Done.
  3. **Ask an AI assistant.** NetOrbit exposes tools to Claude, ChatGPT and other assistants through Home Assistant's MCP Server, and to Assist. The assistant walks you through each piece of gear and does the placing. See [docs/ASSISTANT.md](docs/ASSISTANT.md).
- **Looks good even when it knows nothing.** If no source reports the layout, devices are grouped by type (TV and media, computers and phones, cameras, smart home) until you place them.
- **Remembers when it last saw each device.** Green = answering, yellow = seen within your window (24 h by default), red = gone longer than that. Survives restarts.
- **Events for automations,** plus ready-made notification blueprints.
- **Lightweight.** One ping round per interval (default 60 s), one subnet sweep every 5 minutes, one SNMP question per device per hour. A few kilobits per second.

## Tested on simulated networks

Every release is run against hundreds of generated home networks (see [the network simulator](#the-network-simulator)). These are a few of them, drawn by the real card from the real integration's output.

| Router only, 25 devices | Mesh with nothing reporting placement |
| --- | --- |
| ![](docs/sim-flat-25.png) | ![](docs/sim-mesh.png) |

| UniFi | Managed switches with SNMP |

| ![](docs/sim-unifi.png) | ![](docs/sim-snmp.png) |

| 330 devices behind three managed switches | 360 devices on a busy mesh network |

| After three rounds of DHCP changes |

| ![](docs/sim-dhcp-tip.png) |

Big networks fold quiet devices into "+N more" bubbles (tap one to see the list), while devices that need attention and possible hubs always stay on the map. In the DHCP shot the router reshuffled addresses three times; every name, icon and placement followed its MAC address, and hovering a device whose IP changed shows the reservation tip.

## Placing devices by hand

Whatever NetOrbit can't work out, you can fix in about a minute. Full guide, including turning on SNMP so you barely have to: **[docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md)**.

## What your network can tell NetOrbit

| Your setup | Hubs found | Devices placed under the right hub |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UniFi with the UniFi integration | Automatically | Automatically (wireless clients) |
| Managed switches with SNMP on | Automatically | Automatically (wired and wireless, through the switch port) |
| Netgear/Orbi with the Netgear integration | Suggested | Automatically, once you enable its "connected AP" sensors |
| eero, Google/Nest Wifi, Deco, Velop, ISP routers | Suggested | By you: drag and drop, paste a list, or an AI assistant |

How to turn each of these on, step by step: [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md).

Placement you choose always wins over automatic placement. Each device shows how it was placed, and *Automatic* hands it back to NetOrbit.

## Install

NetOrbit installs from the Home Assistant **Marketplace** (Home Assistant 2026.11 and newer) or from **HACS** (older versions). It's the same repository either way. HACS is built into Home Assistant as the Marketplace starting with 2026.11, which is expected around early November 2026. Until that release is out and settled, the exact screens below may differ a little.

NetOrbit needs Home Assistant 2026.2 or newer.

### Marketplace (Home Assistant 2026.11 and newer)

[![Open NetOrbit in the Marketplace](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/marketplace_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/marketplace_repository/?owner=the-scott-davis&repository=netorbit&category=integration)

1. Click the button above, or go to **Settings > Marketplace** and add `https://github.com/the-scott-davis/netorbit` as a custom repository with type **Integration**. Adding a custom repository asks you to connect a GitHub account once.
2. Download **NetOrbit**. Home Assistant shows a warning that community code runs with full access to your home; read it and confirm.
3. Set it up when asked, or go to **Settings > Devices & services > Add integration > NetOrbit**. The subnet and router are filled in for you. No restart is needed for a first install.
4. Refresh your browser once so the card loads, then [add the map to a dashboard](#add-the-map-to-a-dashboard).

Updates show up in **Settings > Updates** like any other. Updating still needs a restart.

### HACS (Home Assistant 2026.10 and older)

[![Open NetOrbit in HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=the-scott-davis&repository=netorbit&category=integration)

1. In HACS, open the menu, choose **Custom repositories**, add `https://github.com/the-scott-davis/netorbit` with type **Integration**.
2. Download **NetOrbit** and restart Home Assistant.
3. Go to **Settings > Devices & services > Add integration > NetOrbit**.
4. [Add the map to a dashboard](#add-the-map-to-a-dashboard).

HACS on 2026.10 and older shows a blank icon for NetOrbit in its list. That's expected: older HACS only looks up icons on Home Assistant's brand site, which no longer takes new custom integrations. NetOrbit ships its own icon, which Home Assistant shows on the integration's page and the Marketplace shows everywhere.

When you later update to 2026.11, Home Assistant moves NetOrbit into the Marketplace for you. Nothing to reinstall, and your settings stay.

### Manual

Copy `custom_components/netorbit` into your Home Assistant `config/custom_components` folder, restart, add the integration under **Settings > Devices & services**, then [add the map to a dashboard](#add-the-map-to-a-dashboard). You won't get update notifications this way.

## Add the map to a dashboard

Setting up the integration starts tracking your devices (you'll see them as entities), but the map itself is a dashboard card. Add it once:

1. Open a dashboard and click the pencil (**Edit dashboard**) in the top right.
2. Click **Add card**, search for **NetOrbit**, pick it and save.

Or paste this into a **Manual** card:

```yaml
type: custom:netorbit-card
title: Home Network
```

**Full screen looks best.** Go to **Settings > Dashboards > Add dashboard** and make one just for the map. Edit its view, set the view type to **Panel (single card)**, and add the NetOrbit card there.

**NetOrbit isn't in the card search, or the card says "Custom element doesn't exist"?** First make sure you've added the integration under **Settings > Devices & services**. The card only loads once NetOrbit is set up there. Then do a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R, or Cmd+Shift+R on a Mac). The integration serves the card itself, so normally there's no dashboard resource to add. If it still won't load on Home Assistant 2026.10 or older, update NetOrbit to 0.2.3 or newer, or add `/netorbit/netorbit-card.js` as a **JavaScript module** under **Settings > Dashboards > three-dot menu > Resources** and remove it again after updating.

Next: tap any device for its details, and use **Edit layout** to place anything NetOrbit couldn't work out. The [setup guide](docs/SETUP.md) covers getting more of it placed for you.

<p align="right"><sub><a href="#netorbit">back to the map</a></sub></p>

## Settings

Under the integration's **Configure** menu:

| Option | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Review suggested hubs | Confirm or dismiss everything NetOrbit thinks might be network gear. |
| Paste a client list | Paste a client list from an access point, app or switch, pick the hub, and every device in it is placed there. |
| Add / edit a hub | Add gear NetOrbit can't see, rename hubs, change what they connect to. |
| Track / edit a device | Name, icon, hub (or *Automatic*), "allowed to sleep", stop tracking. |
| Review new devices | In manual mode, choose which newly found devices to track. |
| Settings | Tracking mode, ping and scan intervals, the "not seen" window, randomized MACs, automatic hubs, grouping by type, the internet check, SNMP on/off and SNMP community. |

**Tracking mode:** *Automatic* tracks everything it finds. *Manual* only tracks devices you add, and lists the rest under "New devices".

**Allowed to sleep** is for TVs, consoles and anything else that's off a lot. They still show their status but never fire the stale event.

**The internet check** (on by default) puts an Internet node just above your router. Each ping round also pings two public DNS servers, Cloudflare's `1.1.1.1` and Google's `8.8.8.8`. The node turns red ("Internet down") when neither answers for two rounds in a row while your router still answers, so you can tell an internet outage from a Wi-Fi problem. If the router isn't answering either, it shows grey, because NetOrbit can't tell. Turn it off under **Settings** if you'd rather NetOrbit never sends anything outside your network.

### DHCP, MAC addresses and keeping your setup

Most homes hand out addresses with DHCP, so a device's IP can change at any time. NetOrbit is built for that:

- **Everything is keyed by MAC address.** Names, icons, hub placement, "allowed to sleep" and history all follow the device's MAC, so a new IP changes nothing. When a device's IP changes, NetOrbit just pings the new one.
- **Hubs follow their MAC too.** If an access point gets a new IP, NetOrbit notices on the next sweep and updates it.
- **Devices added by IP switch to their MAC** as soon as NetOrbit sees them on the network, so they survive the next DHCP change as well.
- **Renaming works either way.** Rename in NetOrbit's settings, from an AI assistant, or in Home Assistant's own entity settings; the map uses whichever name you set.
- **Back up your setup.** `netorbit.export_config` returns every name, icon, hub and placement, keyed by MAC. `netorbit.import_config` restores it (merging by default), for example after reinstalling.

Tips for the tidiest map:

- **Give network gear a DHCP reservation** (sometimes called a static lease or address reservation) in your router: switches, access points and mesh nodes. NetOrbit copes without it, but reserved addresses keep everything else that talks to them happy too. Hovering a hub whose IP has changed shows this tip.
- **Reserve addresses for devices other things depend on**, like printers, NAS boxes, cameras and Home Assistant itself. Hovering a device whose IP keeps changing shows a reminder.
- **Phones and laptops** usually use a private (randomized) MAC address per network. NetOrbit hides those by default. Turn off *Ignore randomized MAC addresses* if you want them: on current phones the private address normally stays the same for your network unless the phone is set to rotate it.

### SNMP

SNMP is how managed switches share their MAC address tables. NetOrbit only ever reads (it never changes anything). Once an hour it asks devices whether they speak SNMP using the factory "public" community. Your own community is only sent to hubs, suggested hubs and gear from network makers, because SNMP v2c sends it unencrypted and any device that receives it could read it.

- If your switches still use the factory read-only community, there's nothing to do.
- If you changed it (good idea), enter it under **Settings > SNMP community**. Letters and numbers only work best; some switches silently ignore communities with symbols.
- Where to turn SNMP on for UniFi, Omada and other switches, and which switches don't have it: [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md#2-turn-on-snmp-on-managed-switches).
- Consumer routers and mesh systems don't support SNMP. That's normal.

## Card options

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | `Network` | Card title. |
| `height` | `900` | Maximum height in pixels. |
| `show_ip` | `false` | Show hub IPs under their names instead of the hub type. Off by default so screenshots are safe to share. |
| `show_legend` | `true` | Show the legend at the bottom. |
| `show_internet` | `true` | Show the Internet node above the router (needs the internet check turned on in the integration's settings). |
| `group_by_type` | `true` | Group unplaced devices by type. |
| `hide_sleepy_offline` | `false` | Hide sleep-allowed devices while they're offline. |
| `max_devices` | `80` | Above this many devices, each hub shows its problem devices first and folds the rest into a "+N more" bubble. |
| `zoom` | `true` | Pinch, double-tap, Ctrl/Cmd+scroll or the + and − buttons zoom the map; drag to look around while zoomed in. `false` for a fixed map. |
| `device_id` | | Only show one NetOrbit entry when you have several. |

Hover a device for details, tap it for its history. Pinch or double-tap to zoom in on a busy part of the map (Ctrl/Cmd+scroll with a mouse, or the + and − buttons), drag to look around, and zoom out again to scroll the page past the map. Admins get an **Edit layout** button.

<p align="right"><sub><a href="#netorbit">back to the map</a></sub></p>

## Entities, events and services

- One sensor per hub and tracked device. State is `online`, `recent` or `stale`. Attributes include `ip`, `mac`, `vendor`, `link` (the hub), `placement` (`manual`, `controller`, `snmp` or `none`), `last_seen`, `hostname` and `sleepy`.
- `sensor.netorbit_devices_online` counts online devices and lists `new_devices` and `suggested_hubs`. While a network scan runs it also shows `scanning: true`, the current `scan_phase` (`ping`, `arp`, `names`, `snmp`, `layout`), a rough `scan_progress` (0 to 100) and how many addresses it has `found` so far. `first_scan_done` turns true once the very first scan on this install has finished.
- `sensor.netorbit_internet` (when the internet check is on): `online`, `stale` (down while the router answers) or unknown.

| Event | Data |
| --- | --- |
| `netorbit_new_device` | `name`, `ip`, `mac` |
| `netorbit_device_stale` | `name`, `ip`, `mac`, `kind`, `last_seen` |
| `netorbit_device_recovered` | `name`, `ip`, `mac`, `kind`, `last_seen` |
| `netorbit_internet_down` | `since` |
| `netorbit_internet_up` | `since` |

Every service returns a response describing what it did. Devices can be given by name, IP or MAC; hubs by name or id.

| Service | Fields |
| --- | --- |
| `netorbit.assign_device` | `device` (one or a list), `hub` |
| `netorbit.reset_placement` | `device` |
| `netorbit.import_client_list` | `hub`, `text`, `add_missing` |
| `netorbit.add_hub` | `name` or `device`, `type`, `parent`, `ip`, `mac` |
| `netorbit.update_hub` | `hub`, `name`, `type`, `parent` |
| `netorbit.remove_hub` | `hub` |
| `netorbit.confirm_hub` | `device`, `type`, `name` |
| `netorbit.dismiss_hub` | `device` |
| `netorbit.track_device` | `mac` or `ip`, `name`, `icon`, `hub`, `sleepy` |
| `netorbit.export_config` | none (returns your settings, keyed by MAC) |
| `netorbit.import_config` | `data` (an export), `replace` |
| `netorbit.ignore_device` | `device` or `mac` or `ip` |
| `netorbit.scan_now` | none |

### Blueprints

- [Notify when a device goes offline](blueprints/automation/netorbit/device_offline_notify.yaml)
- [Notify when a new device joins](blueprints/automation/netorbit/new_device_notify.yaml)

Import either from **Settings > Automations & scenes > Blueprints > Import blueprint** using the file's GitHub URL. The Marketplace and HACS install the integration only, so blueprints are always imported this way.

## Requirements and limits

- Home Assistant needs to be on the same network as your devices, with host networking. Home Assistant OS and supervised installs are. Docker installs need `network_mode: host`.
- Presence is based on ping. Devices that block ping show as not seen even when connected. Mark them as allowed to sleep, or ignore them.
- Phones and laptops often use a private MAC address per network. Those are ignored by default since they can change, and they roam between access points anyway.
- If an access point and wired devices share one switch port through an unmanaged switch, the switch can't tell them apart, so those wired devices may be drawn under the access point. Move them by hand if it matters to you.
- Placements from pasted lists are a snapshot. TVs, cameras and smart home gear stay put, so that's fine for them.
- IPv4 only, up to 1024 hosts per entry. Add one entry per subnet if you have several.

<p align="right"><sub><a href="#netorbit">back to the map</a></sub></p>

## Privacy

NetOrbit runs on your network. The only thing it sends outside it is the internet check: a ping to `1.1.1.1` and `8.8.8.8` each round, which you can turn off under **Settings**. No data about your network goes with it. Maker names come from a list bundled with Home Assistant. Diagnostics downloads replace every IP, MAC and name with placeholders, so they're safe to attach to an issue. The card hides IPs by default.

## Roadmap

- Omada placement through the Omada controller.
- ARP based presence for devices that block ping.
- A visual card editor.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome from anyone, no permission needed. Fork the repo, make a branch, and open a PR against `main`. PRs are squash-merged with you kept as the commit author, so you show up in the history and the Contributors list. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the full steps, what CI checks, and how review and releases work.

To run the checks locally:

```bash
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements_test.txt
pytest
node --test tests/card.test.js
python scripts/check_examples.py
```

The section map at the top of this page is drawn by `python scripts/docs/nav.py` (it needs the `mdi.js` file described below).

Examples, tests and docs only use the address ranges reserved for documentation (`192.0.2.x`, `00:00:5e:00:53:xx`), never values from a real network. `scripts/check_examples.py` enforces that, and CI runs it on every push.

Preview the card with fake data: `npm i @mdi/js@7.4.47` and copy `node_modules/@mdi/js/mdi.js` to `scripts/preview/`, serve the repo root (`python -m http.server 8766`), and open `http://localhost:8766/scripts/preview/index.html?s=full` (or `mesh`, `flat`, `novice`). `scripts/preview/interact.js` drives edit mode in a real browser with Playwright.

### The network simulator

`tests/test_simulation.py` generates hundreds of home networks with a known true layout (flat routers, mesh with nothing reporting, UniFi, one or several managed switches, unmanaged switches in between, routers that speak SNMP, odd gateways, randomized MACs, devices that ignore ping, DHCP churn, aged-out MAC table entries, wrong SNMP communities, duplicate and non-ASCII names, up to several hundred devices) and runs the real integration against each one. It fails on crashes, duplicates, loops, devices placed on the wrong branch, manual placement not winning, state lost on restart, or real addresses in diagnostics. `pytest -s -k simulation` prints a report of how much it found and placed.

To draw every simulated map in a browser and check for errors and overlaps: `NETORBIT_DUMP=scripts/preview/_simstates pytest -k simulation`, serve the repo root, then `node scripts/preview/fuzz.js`.
